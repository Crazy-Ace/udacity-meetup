## Description

This meetup website should help people schedule events, create a guest list and meet the other [requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) of the course.

## Tech Stack

* Front end: [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular)
* Backend (as-a-service): [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Scaffolding: [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.6.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
