## [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Requirements
These are the requirements from Udacity.

### Meet-Up Event Planner

Prepare for this project with [Building High Conversion Web Forms](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud890/lessons/5246461689/concepts/53872450300923) and [Web Tooling and Automation](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892/lessons/5331771247/concepts/53272908270923).

#### Requirements

_You do not need to create a functioning back-end or save user information. Only the form components themselves and their performance will be evaluated._

1) You do not need to create a real back-end or save user information, but the app must provide a form for users to create an account. Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

- Name
- Email address
- Secure password (with character and length requirements)
- Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2) The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

- Name of the event
- Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
- Event host (could be an individual’s name or an organization)
- Event start date and time
- Event end date and time
- Guest list
- Location
- Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event

3) The app should display events that have been created.

4) Review the evaluation rubric for this project early and often.

#### Tips, Tricks, and Advice

- You may find that you want to save user information in some way, as opposed to just hard-coding in a few events to meet the “display events” requirement. You could accomplish this by using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) or by using a “back-end as a service” platform like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
- You can use any framework you’d like - or don’t! It’s up to you.
